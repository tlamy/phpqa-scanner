# PhpQA

THis is the scanner portion of PhpQA. It scans your source code with multiple static analyzers, like phpstan or psalm,
and transmits their findings to the PhpQA Server, where there are stored and used to visualize your quality progress.

It's design is borrowed from SonarQube, which, unforunately, not allows for external scanners or rules.
